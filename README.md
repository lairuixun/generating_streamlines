# generating_streamlines
A Fortran code which generates streamlines based on velocity field, streamline function and numerically solved by Rungeâ€“Kutta method was made available. The nodes of streamlines were transformed into shapefile data format for interpolation. The final bathymetry of the example river can be interpolated using general GIS software such as ArcGIS or QGIS.
